For this problem, you will implement both fixed-length and variable-length encoding schemes, and
compare their compression rates on two different input files.
You are given two data files: random.txt, and assignment.txt. Both files contain the same
number of characters, but with different distributions. The file assignment.txt contains the text
of this assignment part B, whereas random.txt contains characters randomly selected from along
upper- and lower-case letters (ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZabcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz), numbers (0123456789), 
spaces, and the characters , . - ~ ( ) { } " ' @ # % ^ & * + / \ \n.
You will implement three encoding schemes. For each scheme, encoding is done by looking up
each character in a table, and replacing that character with a given sequence of bits. To keep it easy
to compare and reason about the results, each encoder will generate a string of 0s and 1s, rather than
actual binary output. This will make it easiest for you to compare the lengths of the encoded strings.
